        "2. What is exception handling in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    :- Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that occur while a program is running. It allows a program to respond to errors instead of crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   :- In Python exception handling, the \"finally\" block is used to execute a specific code snippet regardless of whether an exception is raised or not within the \"try\" block, essentially ensuring that certain cleanup tasks like closing files or network connections are always performed, even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is logging in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        " :- Python logging is a module that records events that occur while a program is running. It's a useful tool for debugging, troubleshooting, and monitoring a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        " :-__del__ is a finalizer. It is called when an object is garbage\n",
        " collected which happens at some point after all references to the object have been deleted. In a simple case this could be right after you say del x or, if x is a local variable, after the function ends.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        " :- Namespace pollution: The import statement imports the entire module into the current namespace, which can lead to namespace pollution and naming conflicts. The from statement imports only the specified attributes, which can help to avoid these issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        " :-In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions using try-except blocks. You can use multiple except blocks to catch different types of exceptions, or you can use a single except clause to catch multiple exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        " :-The with statement in Python helps manage resources, like files, by ensuring they are closed after use. This makes code cleaner and more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing ?\n",
        "\n",
        " :- Multithreading\n",
        "Uses a single process to run multiple threads simultaneously\n",
        "Each thread runs a process and shares resources with other threads in the same process\n",
        "Multithreading is good for I/O bound tasks\n",

        "\n",
        " :- Logging in a program helps developers identify and fix problems, monitor performance, and improve security. It can also help improve customer experience and reduce response times.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  :-Memory management in Python is the process of allocating and freeing up memory for programs to run efficiently. Python automatically handles memory management tasks, which can improve program performance and reduce memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        " :- 1. Use the try block to test code for errors.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. Use the except block to handle errors that occur in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. Use the else block to run code if no exceptions occur in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. Use the finally block to run code regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        " :- Memory management in Python is important because it helps to write efficient code, reduce the risk of errors, and prevent memory leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling ?\n",
        "\n",
        " :- In Python, the try and except blocks are used to handle exceptions, or errors, in a program. The try block tests a block of code for errors, and the except block handles those errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work ?\n",
        "\n",
        " :-  Python's garbage collection system automatically removes objects from memory that are no longer in use. It uses a combination of reference counting and generational garbage collection to manage memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling ?\n",
        "\n",
        " :- The purpose of the else block in exception handling is to execute code when no exceptions occur in the try block. It's useful for performing specific actions when the try block succeeds.\n",
        "  \n",
        "\n",
        "  17.  What are the common logging levels in Python ?\n",

        "            \n",
        "    :- multiprocessing is a higher-level interface to execute a part of the currently running program.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Therefore, it - as forking does - creates a copy of your process current state. That is to say, it takes care of the forking of your program for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "  19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  :- Because files are limited resources managed by the operating system, making sure files are closed after use will protect against hard-to-debug issues like running out of file handles or experiencing corrupted data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python ?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  :-In Python, the `read()` method is used to read a specified number of characters from a file or input stream, while the `readline()` method is used to read a single line from a file or input stream. The `read()` method will read the entire content of the file or stream if no argument is provided, returning a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "  21. What is the logging module in Python used for ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  :- The logging module in Python is used to track events that happen while a program is running. It's a built-in feature in the Python standard library.\n",
        "\n",
        "  22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  :- Python has a built-in os module with methods for interacting with the operating system, like creating files and directories, management of files and directories, input, output, environment variables, process management, etc. The os module has the following set of methods and constants.\n",
        "\n",
        "  23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python ?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  :- Memory leaks\n",
        "Unused memory can accumulate over time, leading to memory exhaustion and performance degradation.\n",
        "\n",
        " Slower program runtimes\n",
        "Python sometimes holds freed memory in the interpreter instead of freeing it up for the operating system.\n",
        "\n",
        " Inefficient memory usage\n",
        "Python's small object manager rarely returns memory back to the operating system.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.  How do you raise an exception manually in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        " :- As a Python developer you can choose to throw an exception if a condition occurs. To throw (or raise) an exception, use the raise keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications ?\n",
        "\n",
        " :- Multithreading is important in certain applications because it can improve performance, scalability, and responsiveness. It allows multiple threads to run simultaneously, which can help applications use system resources more efficiently.\n",
